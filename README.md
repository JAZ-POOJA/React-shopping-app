React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. React is a popular and widely used programming language at present since almost every web developer or a full-stack developer is using it
We can design simple views for each state in our application. We can build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
React components implement a render() method that takes input data and returns what to display.

This Shopping Application UI is a result of my learnings in React . I have implemented wtever i could learn and designed a shopping application frontend in React.
The homepage gives you the overall idea of the shopping app , the ongoing hot deals and new arrivals . Also one can get contact information and can get in touch with the seller 
through the newsletter .

I can also designed user-interactive Login and Register page. 
There is Product page and Productlist page . Product page gives the detailed information of any product including its price , size availability and color choices.
ProductList page contains products , new arrivals and products according to categories.

Demo of the shopping app can be found in demo folder.
